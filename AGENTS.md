# Agent Workflow

## Local source and Vercel

- For routine feature work and fixes, make and validate changes in the local project only. Do not deploy to Vercel directly; the user will commit/push through Git and let the connected Vercel project deploy from that source.
- Keep local source as the source of truth. Do not make dashboard-only or production-only changes that are absent from the repository.
- Direct Vercel changes or deployments are reserved for an active production incident when they are necessary to restore service. Keep the corresponding source change in the repository so Git-based deployments do not undo the fix.
- Do not commit, push, or deploy unless the user explicitly asks for that action.
